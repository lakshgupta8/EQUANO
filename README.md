## ✨ Features

- 🧮 **Multiple Equations**: Add, edit, or remove multiple expressions like `y = x^2`, `y = sin(x)`, `x = cos(y)`.
- 🎯 **Real-Time Rendering**: Graphs update live as you type.
- 🎨 **Canvas Rendering**: Smooth, pixel-perfect rendering with grid and axis.
- 🔍 **Zoom & Pan**: Navigate graphs easily with mouse or touch gestures.
- 📱 **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- ⚙️ **Expression Parsing**: Supports complex functions (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, `log`, `sqrt`).
- 💾 **Local State Persistence** *(Optional)*: Retains graphs between sessions using local storage.
